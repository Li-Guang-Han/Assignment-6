I saw the feedback from Assignment 5 and cloned by previous Assignment 5 and 6 to make sure the build succeeded. The build failed so i deleted and reuploaded the files for Assignment 6, it should succeed now.
I don't know why Assignment 6 did not succeed in the clone but it works in my own folder. As for Assignment 5 I forgot to delete the Choice file after commits
6 should build now
